Hi, I'm James.

I write detections. 

Currently, I'm focused on writing threat-led detections in Python. All detections are tested on real and/or synthetic logs. 

Feel free to use any part of this repository, and please reference me if you do.

Open to feedback - message me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/bullen/


Instructions to build and run coming soon...
